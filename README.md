This is a collection of self-written Python tools

I'm sure these tools exist elsewhere, but these are here for me to utilize them and use them in other larger scripts.

To run these scripts you'll need to install Python.
Then, on your machine, figure out how to install these 3rd party tools:
* netmiko
* getpass
